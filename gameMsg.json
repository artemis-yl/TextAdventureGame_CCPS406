Little do you know that the Galactic Empire has secretly begun constructing a new armored space station known as the DS-3 Orbital Battle Station (i.e. Planet Killer 3). Intel has also shown that during your time away, the Empireâ€™s evil leader, Dark Vader, has returned, captured your freedom fighter friend Lia, and plans to thwart your much-deserved vacation by using the Planet Killer to destroy your homeworld. Meanwhile, a mysterious yet friendly Jaydai has already infiltrated DS-3.",
