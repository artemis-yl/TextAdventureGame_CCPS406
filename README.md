> Once upon a time, in a distant galaxy, you, the player, find yourself back on your home planet, looking forward to a peaceful winter break. Unbeknownst to you, the Galactic Empire has initiated the covert construction of a formidable space station called the DS-3 Orbital Battle Station, also known as Planet Killer 3. Intelligence reports reveal that in your absence, the Empire's malevolent leader, Dark Vader, has resurfaced, captured your freedom fighter comrade, Lia, and intends to disrupt your well-deserved vacation by deploying the Planet Killer to annihilate your homeworld.
