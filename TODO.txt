

-No introductory dialogue
-No room description for the starting room, since we don't "move" into it
-descriptions for items, rooms are printed on one long line
-room description doesn't switch from description to description2 on reentry to a room
-On entry to a room, the rooms name is announced, along with the rooms description which states the name of the room in
    the first sentence, one of these is redundant.
-Possibly rework how game ends, rather than on use of sabotage device (formerly k10) while in sabotage room,
    to reflect our actual game, game should end on return to hangar bay (post use of sabotage device)
-Remove debug print-out on game exit

Possible minor changes:
-if item is key and is used, it could be deleted from the inventory
