# To-Do and Planning Doc
Update each week what we need to do, who does it, etc.


## Week 1 - 16/9/23
**What's left:**
- Pick a coding convention/style
  - Maybe [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) or [Pyink](https://github.com/google/pyink) to adhere to PEP8 standard and not have to worry about it

**What's done:**
- Organize the group: (for now just names? unlikely to need student #, and best not to that share publically)
  - Artemis (Yulim Lee)
  - Long
  - Adnan Ali
  - Yamah Jaleel
- Set up Github
- Settle on programming language
  - Python3 + JSON
