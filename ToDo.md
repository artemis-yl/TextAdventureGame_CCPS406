# To-Do and Planning Doc
Update each week what we need to do, who does it, etc.

**General To-Do:**
- learn hwo to git bash / use guthub
- get more comfortable with python3, and JSON
- EVERYONE NEEDS TO INSTALL AND USE [BLACK](https://github.com/psf/black) 

## Week 4 - 7/10/23
**What's left:**
- create json files and a base template for each type (i.e. character, room, puzzle, otherItems)
- create at least 1 sample of each type
- create report explaining why we choose to structure our Data this way, with the sample JSONs

**What's done:**
- discussion on combat:
  - we want to avoid combat, emphasis is on puzzle solving and stealth (may change)
  - simple as possible AKA you shoot he dies
    - ex) if Player meets Dark Vader, Player will die UNLESS he has All allies; beamsaber; the force, in which case Dark Vader dies



## Week 2-3 
**What's done:**
- we submitted our storyline document and map on Sunday, 1/10/23
- we duscuseed on overall details
  - characters are Player, Lia (friend and rebel), Jaydai, and Dark Vader (final boss)
  - 


## Week 1 - 16/9/23
**What's left:**
- Pick a coding convention/style
  - Maybe [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) or [Pyink](https://github.com/google/pyink) to adhere to PEP8 standard and not have to worry about it

**What's done:**
- Organize the group: (for now just names? unlikely to need student #, and best not to that share publically)
  - Artemis (Yulim Lee)
  - Long
  - Adnan Ali
  - Yamah Jaleel
- Set up Github
- Settle on programming language
  - Python3 + JSON
