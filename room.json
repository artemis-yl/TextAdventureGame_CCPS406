        "description": "You quietly slip out of the empty cargo container that you had hidden inside to smuggle yourself onto the DS-3 Orbital Battle Station. Glancing at the wall you notice that you find yourself in 'Freight Hangar Bay #03'. Down the isle of stacked cargo containers, you see a dimly lit room with a glowing sign above it, reading 'Inventory Office'. You check your watch and just as you had planned, the staff are in the midst of a shift change. As you walk towards the office, you realize that you'll have some time here alone to get oriented and maybe pick up some clues left behind by the personnel from the last shift.",

As the hall extends further from the entrance, there are recessed security doors, each with their own control panel. The doors sit at even intervals along the walls and lead to cramped, individual holding cells. Each door has a light above it, with some glowing red, most likely to indicate the occupancy status of the cell. At the opposite end of this narrow room is a final cell, its light casting a red glare on the floor below.",
        "description2": "You find yourself back inside of the jail block. Within the cells of this narrow, dark hallway is where the prisoners of the DS-3 Station are held in captivity. The doors look very secure and sturdy, it seems the only way to get through them is by using the control panel.",

The vaulted-ceilinged room is enclosed by intricately decorated walls, covered in the blood-red and charcoal patterns of some ancient culture. Dimly glowing light fixtures hang from chains suspended from the ceiling, illuminating the room in an eerie, dark light. In the center of the room is an oval-shaped resting chamber, surrounded by some strange devices, while along the walls are a series of ornate display cases housing mysterious looking artifacts. The air within the room feels as if it has steeped in an evil presence.",
        "description2": "You find yourself back inside of the station leader's personal quarters. You strain to narrow your focus and not become distracted by the evil looking decor.

They seem to be workstations for security personnel, evidenced by the many monitors displaying surveillance camera feeds of various points within the DS-3 Station. In one corner of the far end of the room there is a stairwell leading to a raised observation platform that holds a seat overlooking the room. Ontop of the platform, a door leads elsewhere. In the other corner of the room there is a metal-barred office titled 'Inmate Processing' that surrounds a secure-looking door titled 'Jail Block'.",

The room is so large, you notice a faint mist hovering along the far reaches of the chamber. Midway into the room is a series of flights of stairs, spanning wall-to-wall and interspersed by brief platforms, leading upwards to the final level. Atop this peak sits a large jagged throne made of some dark, light-absorbing material that gives the seat an appearance as if it is made of shadows. Within the shadows, you can just barely make out the silhouette of some ominous figure.",

Although you see no guards, you feel a mysterious presence watching you. You notice the walls are heavily reinforced and covered by black, energy absorbing panelling. There is a massive, open shaft running vertically through the floor and ceiling of the sphere. In the center of the shaft is a large, suspended, spherical machine with crackling energy visible from behind small observation windows. Access walkways branch off from the edges of the room and lead to the machine. The whole room buzzes with the immense energy emanating from within the device, which you determine to be the reactor.",
